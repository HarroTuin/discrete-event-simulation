# Discrete-event simulation
This repository contains the basic modules needed for a discrete-event simulation of any queuing system. 
The simulator can be used as a basis for most other types of discrete-event simulations. This repository contains an example of a simulation of a G/G/c queuing system based on the lecture notes of the stochastic simulation course of the Eindhoven University of Technology.
