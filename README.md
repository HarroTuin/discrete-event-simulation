# Discrete-event simulator
This repository contains the basic modules needed for a discrete event simulation of a queuing system. 
The simulator can be used as a basis for most other types of discrete-event simulations. This repository contains an example of a simulation of a G/G/c queuing system from the stochastic simulation course of the Eindhoven Univeristy of Technology.
